# 👋 Hi, I'm Mihir

I transitioned from a sales career into tech — now building products for my bootstrapped, single-person startup [@pawprintf](https://github.com/pawprintf).  
I primarily work with **Flutter**, **Next.js**, **Django**, and **Firebase**.

### What I Do
- On a mission to design, build, and ship multiple high-quality consumer products  
- Experimenting with AI tools to accelerate design, development, packaging, and promotion  
- Deeply invested in Flutter. Almost everything I build is cross-platform by default  

### Goal
To build in validated markets first, then progressively take on more ambitious projects as I grow.
