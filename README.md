# Hi, I'm Mihir

I transitioned from a sales career into tech; now building products for my bootstrapped, single-person startup [@pawprintf](https://github.com/pawprintf).  
I primarily work with **Flutter**, **Next.js**, **Django**, and **Firebase**.

- Working to build, and ship multiple high-quality consumer products  
- Love Flutter. Almost everything I build should be cross-platform by default
